			<p name="blurb">Our 12th Annual Intercollegiate Trading Competition brings in top students from around the world to pit their trading strategies against each other head to head. The competition will be held on November 10, 2019, with networking events with our sponsors the day before.<br><br>
The competition will take place at the MIT Media Lab and consist of three cases focusing on algorithmic trading. Students will devise trading strategies in Python prior to the competition, as well as work on a day-of case at the competition.
<br><br>Students may apply in teams of up to two. Each year, approximately 120 students compete from top universities including MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale. All accepted competitors will be provided housing and full travel reimbursement.
