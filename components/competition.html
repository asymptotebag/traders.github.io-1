				from around the country to pit their trading strategies against each other in our annual two-day event. <br><br>
				Our Fall 2022 competition will be held in-person on <b>November 5th and 6th, 2022 at the MIT Media Lab</b>.
				Competitors will work in pairs on trading strategies to compete in two cases released during the competition.<br><br>
				Students may apply in teams of up to two. Each year, approximately 120 students compete from top universities 
				including MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale. All accepted competitors will be provided breakfast, lunch, and
				housing accommodations during competition weekend, and will participate in exclusive networking opportunities with sponsors 
				from top trading firms.
