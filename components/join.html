			<p>Traders@MIT is a small, close-knit group of twenty undergraduate students. We have a relatively flat structure, and all board members are given the opportunity to contribute.<br><br>
New members will benefit from our mentorship and education program. No trading experience is required, and we teach weekly seminars in the spring on topics in trading and quantitative finance.<br><br>
In the fall, we primarily work to organize our annual trading competition, the largest of its kind in the country. Members will design competition cases, develop our trading exchange, and coordinate logistics to ensure our competition runs smoothly.<br><br>
Throughout the year, we organize fun social events, including dinners and retreats. We’d love to have you join us!
